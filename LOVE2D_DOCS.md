love
When beginning to write games using LÖVE, the most important parts of the API are the callbacks: love.load to do one-time setup of your game, love.update which is used to manage your game's state frame-to-frame, and love.draw which is used to render the game state onto the screen.

More interactive games will override additional callbacks in order to handle input from the user, and other aspects of a full-featured game.

LÖVE provides default placeholders for these callbacks, which you can override inside your own code by creating your own function with the same name as the callback:

-- Load some default values for our rectangle.
function love.load()
    x, y, w, h = 20, 20, 60, 20
end

-- Increase the size of the rectangle every frame.
function love.update(dt)
    w = w + 1
    h = h + 1
end

-- Draw a coloured rectangle.
function love.draw()
    -- In versions prior to 11.0, color component values are (0, 102, 102)
    love.graphics.setColor(0, 0.4, 0.4)
    love.graphics.rectangle("fill", x, y, w, h)
end

love.filesystem
Provides an interface to the user's filesystem.

This module provides access to files in specific places:

The root folder of the .love archive (or source directory)
The root folder of the game's save directory.
The folder containing the game's .love archive (or source directory), but only if specific conditions are met.
Each game is granted a single directory on the system where files can be saved through love.filesystem. This is the only directory where love.filesystem can write files. These directories will typically be found in something like:

OS	Path	Alternative	Notes
Windows	C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE	%appdata%\LOVE\	When fused, save directory will be created directly inside AppData, rather than as a sub-directory of LOVE.
macOS	/Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/	-	-
Linux	$XDG_DATA_HOME/love/	~/.local/share/love/	-
Android	/data/data/org.love2d.android/files/save/	/sdcard/Android/data/org.love2d.android/files/save/	The alternative path is used when activating t.externalstorage config option. Neither path is accessible through device directly due to Android restrictions.
Files that are opened for write or append will always be created in the save directory. The same goes for other operations that involve writing to the filesystem, like createDirectory.

Files that are opened for read will be looked for in the save directory, and then in the .love archive (in that order). So if a file with a certain filename (and path) exist in both the .love archive and the save folder, the one in the save directory takes precedence.

Note: All paths are relative to the .love archive and save directory. (except for the get*Directory() calls)

It is recommended to set your game's identity first in your conf.lua. You can set it with love.filesystem.setIdentity as well.

love.graphics
The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.

LÖVE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom. It is worth noting that the location (0, 0) aligns with the upper-left corner of the pixel as well, meaning that for some functions you may encounter off-by-one problems in the render output when drawing 1 pixel wide lines. You can try aligning the coordinate system with the center of pixels rather than their upper-left corner. Do this by passing x+0.5 and y+0.5 or using love.graphics.translate().

The LÖVE coordinate system

In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner (See the picture above).


A note about angles in LÖVE: Angles are expressed in terms of radians, with values in the range of 0 to 2pi (approximately 6.28); you may be more used to working in terms of degrees. Because of how the coordinate system is set up, with an origin in the upper left corner, angles in LÖVE may seem a bit backwards: 0 points right (along the X axis), ¼pi points diagonally down and to the right, ½pi points directly down (along the Y axis), with increasing values continuing clockwise.


Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even change rotation in this way.

love.thread
Available since LÖVE 0.7.0
This module is not supported in earlier versions.
Allows you to work with threads.

Threads are separate Lua environments, running in parallel to the main code. As their code runs separately, they can be used to compute complex operations without adversely affecting the frame rate of the main thread. However, as they are separate environments, they cannot access the variables and functions of the main thread, and communication between threads is limited.

All LÖVE objects (userdata) are shared among threads so you'll only have to send their references across threads. You may run into concurrency issues if you manipulate an object or global love state on multiple threads at the same time.


When a Thread is started, it only loads love.data, love.filesystem, and love.thread module. Every other module has to be loaded with require.


LÖVE provides a default implementation of the love.threaderror callback in order to see errors from threads. It can be overwritten and customized, and Thread:getError can also be used.



O.png	The love.graphics, love.window, love.joystick, love.keyboard, love.mouse, and love.touch modules have several restrictions and therefore can only be used in the main thread.	 


O.png	If LÖVE is programmatically restarted, all active threads must stop their work and the main thread must wait for them to finish, otherwise LOVE may fail to start again.	 


Types
Channel	An object which can be used to send and receive data between different threads.	Added since 0.9.0	
Thread	A Thread represents a thread.	Added since 0.7.0	
Functions
love.thread.getChannel	Creates or retrieves a named thread channel.	Added since 0.9.0

love.thread.getThreads	Get all threads.	Added since 0.7.0	Removed in 0.9.0
love.thread.newChannel	Creates a new unnamed thread channel.	Added since 0.9.0	
love.thread.newThread	Creates a new Thread from a filename, string or FileData object containing Lua code.	Added since 0.7.0	


Examples
A simple example showing the general usage of a thread and using channels for communication.

-- This is the code that's going to run on the our thread. It should be moved
-- to its own dedicated Lua file, but for simplicity's sake we'll create it
-- here.
local threadCode = [[
-- Receive values sent via thread:start
local min, max = ...

for i = min, max do
    -- The Channel is used to handle communication between our main thread and
    -- this thread. On each iteration of the loop will push a message to it which
    -- we can then pop / receive in the main thread.
    love.thread.getChannel( 'info' ):push( i )
end
]]

local thread -- Our thread object.
local timer = 0  -- A timer used to animate our circle.

function love.load()
    thread = love.thread.newThread( threadCode )
    thread:start( 99, 1000 )
end

function love.update( dt )
    timer = timer + dt
end

function love.draw()
    -- Get the info channel and pop the next message from it.
    local info = love.thread.getChannel( 'info' ):pop()
    if info then
        love.graphics.print( info, 10, 10 )
    end

    -- We smoothly animate a circle to show that the thread isn't blocking our main thread.
    love.graphics.circle( 'line', 100 + math.sin( timer ) * 20, 100 + math.cos( timer ) * 20, 20 )

lua-enet
Available since LÖVE 0.9.0
This module is not supported in earlier versions.


O.png	Official documentation for lua-enet is available here. ENet's features are listed on its homepage. The official documentation may have typos. The documentation on this wiki reflects Löve's implementation, meaning it should be safe to follow what's written here.	 


lua-enet is a binding to the ENet library for Lua. It comes included with LÖVE.

ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust network communication layer for games on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol).The primary feature it provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery of packets.

ENet omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication, lobbying, server discovery, encryption, or other similar tasks that are particularly application specific so that the library remains flexible, portable, and easily embeddable.

Types
Type	Description
host	An ENet host for communicating with peers.
peer	An ENet peer which data packets may be sent or received from.
event	A simple table containing information on an event.
Functions
Function	Description
host_create	Returns a new host.
linked_version	Returns the included ENet's version string.
Examples
server.lua

-- server.lua
local enet = require "enet"
local host = enet.host_create("localhost:6789")
while true do
  local event = host:service(100)
  while event do
    if event.type == "receive" then
      print("Got message: ", event.data, event.peer)
      event.peer:send( "pong" )
    elseif event.type == "connect" then
      print(event.peer, "connected.")
    elseif event.type == "disconnect" then
      print(event.peer, "disconnected.")
    end
    event = host:service()
  end
end
client.lua

-- client.lua
local enet = require "enet"
local host = enet.host_create()
local server = host:connect("localhost:6789")
while true do
  local event = host:service(100)
  while event do
    if event.type == "receive" then
      print("Got message: ", event.data, event.peer)
      event.peer:send( "ping" )
    elseif event.type == "connect" then
      print(event.peer, "connected.")
      event.peer:send( "ping" )
    elseif event.type == "disconnect" then
      print(event.peer, "disconnected.")
    end
    event = host:service()
  end
end
This is another example that creates a server (receiver) and a client (sender) on the same computer with the same script. The client will say "Hi" to the server endlessly because ClientSend() is called inside love.update.

enet = require "enet"

enethost = nil
hostevent = nil
clientpeer = nil

function love.load(args)

	-- establish host for receiving msg
	enethost = enet.host_create("localhost:6750")
	
	-- establish a connection to host on same PC
	enetclient = enet.host_create()
        clientpeer = enetclient:connect("localhost:6750")

end

function love.update(dt)
	ServerListen()	
	ClientSend()
end

function love.draw()
end

function ServerListen()

	hostevent = enethost:service(100)
	
	if hostevent then
		print("Server detected message type: " .. hostevent.type)
		if hostevent.type == "connect" then 
			print(hostevent.peer, "connected.")
		end
		if hostevent.type == "receive" then
			print("Received message: ", hostevent.data, hostevent.peer)
		end
	end
end

function ClientSend()
	enetclient:service(100)
	clientpeer:send("Hi")
end

socket
Available since LÖVE 0.5.0
This module is not supported in earlier versions.
Implements a luasocket module for TCP/UDP networking. The luasocket module is bundled with love binary, but in order to use it, you need to require the module like this:

local socket = require("socket")
Notes
Prior to 11.0, LÖVE doesn't fully supports non-blocking TCP connections on Windows
Starting with LÖVE 11.0, require("socket") no longer creates a global variable.
When using blocking operations (network connect/read/write, or socket.sleep), the whole LÖVE main loop will be blocked, and it is usually a bad idea. So use only non-blocking operations if possible, or use it in a thread.

utf8
Available since LÖVE 0.9.2
This module is not supported in earlier versions.

This library provides basic support for handling UTF-8 encoded strings.

It provides all its functions inside the table returned by require("utf8"). This library does not provide any support for Unicode other than handling UTF-8 encoding. Any operation that needs the meaning of a character, such as character classification, is outside its scope.

For detailed usage, see the reference manual.

O.png	The utf8.char function does not work correctly in 0.9.2; However, it is not an issue since 0.10.0	 




Examples
Print text the user writes, and erase it using the UTF-8 module.

local utf8 = require("utf8")

function love.load()
    text = "Type away! -- "

    -- enable key repeat so backspace can be held down to trigger love.keypressed multiple times.
    love.keyboard.setKeyRepeat(true)
end

function love.textinput(t)
    text = text .. t
end

function love.keypressed(key)
    if key == "backspace" then
        -- get the byte offset to the last UTF-8 character in the string.
        local byteoffset = utf8.offset(text, -1)

        if byteoffset then
            -- remove the last UTF-8 character.
            -- string.sub operates on bytes rather than UTF-8 characters, so we couldn't do string.sub(text, 1, -2).
            text = string.sub(text, 1, byteoffset - 1)
        end
    end
end

function love.draw()
    love.graphics.printf(text, 0, 0, love.graphics.getWidth())
end
